# Basic Operators in python; such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and others.

a = 27
b = 4

print(f"{a} + {b} = {a+b}\n")  # This is addition it gives 31

print(f"{a} - {b} = {a-b}\n")  # This is subtraction it gives 23

print(f"{a} ร {b} = {a*b}\n")  # This is multiplication it gives 108

print(f"{a} รท {b} = {a/b}\n")  # This is division it gives 6.75

print(f"{a} // {b} = {a//b}\n")  # This is floor division it gives 6

print(f"{a} mod {b} = {a%b}\n")  # This is modulus operator it gives 3

print(f"{a}^{b} = {(a**b):,}\n")  # This is exponentiation it gives 531,441

# f in the print function is a python 3.xx syntax for formatting outputs to the programmers taste. you would learn more of it soon.
# Yo saw it use in the output of line 18.
